This is a graph searching class employing Floyd-Warshall algorithm or All pair Shortest path. The shortest paths are stored in a 2d ArrayList object which is the only private member of the class.

This is a generic class which can work on any type of numeric data only.

Constructors:
FloydWarshall(int): Invokes the Initializemap method to initialize a path matrix of size NxN.

Public Methods declared are:
1. void AllPathSearch() : This method actually computes the shortest paths.
2. T getShortestPath(int,int) : THis method returns the shortest path between any two points in the graph
3. boolean SetPath(int,int,int): This method takes in the graph. A true is returned if the path is acknowledged,otherwise a                                      IndexOutOfBounds exception is thrown and false is returned.
4. void showpath() :This method only prints the all the shortest paths for every node combinations in the form of a matrix.

Private Methods declared are: 
1. void InitializeMap() : Initializes all the distances to the highest value(1000000 taken in this case) except the diaginal elements which are made zero. This is invoked by the constructor itself.
